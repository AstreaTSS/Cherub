<p align="center">An experimental utility bot.</p>

**Cherub** is the successor to [Seraphim](https://github.com/AstreaTSS/Seraphim-Bot), one of my old bots. Instead of trying to do everything at once, Cherub only implements the most useful utilities from its predecessor.

So far, Cherub only has emoji-related commands - the bot can get the emoji URL of any Discord emoji, and has a variety of commands to add emojis in an easy way.
